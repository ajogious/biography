          April 18, 1955, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.) German-born physicist who
          developed the special and general theories of relativity and won the
          Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the
          photoelectric effect. Einstein is generally considered the most
          influential physicist of the 20th century.

    <section class="section-2 container" id="biography" >
      
      <h2 class=" mt-4">Childhood and education</h2>
        <p>
          Einstein’s parents were secular, middle-class Jews. His father,
          Hermann Einstein, was originally a featherbed salesman and later ran
          an electrochemical factory with moderate success. His mother, the
          former Pauline Koch, ran the family household. He had one sister,
          Maria (who went by the name Maja), born two years after Albert.
          </p>
          <p>
          Einstein would write that two “wonders” deeply affected his early
          years. The first was his encounter with a compass at age five. He was
          mystified that invisible forces could deflect the needle. This would
          lead to a lifelong fascination with invisible forces. The second
          wonder came at age 12 when he discovered a book of geometry, which he
          devoured, calling it his “sacred little geometry book.” </p>
          <p>
          Einstein became deeply religious at age 12, even composing several songs in
          praise of God and chanting religious songs on the way to school. This
          began to change, however, after he read science books that
          contradicted his religious beliefs. This challenge to established
          authority left a deep and lasting impression. At the Luitpold
          Gymnasium, Einstein often felt out of place and victimized by a
          Prussian-style educational system that seemed to stifle originality
          and creativity. One teacher even told him that he would never amount
          to anything. </p>
          <p>
          Yet another important influence on Einstein was a young
          medical student, Max Talmud (later Max Talmey), who often had dinner
          at the Einstein home. Talmud became an informal tutor, introducing
          Einstein to higher mathematics and philosophy. A pivotal turning point
          occurred when Einstein was 16 years old. Talmud had earlier introduced
          him to a children’s science series by Aaron Bernstein,
          Naturwissenschaftliche Volksbucher (1867–68; Popular Books on Physical
          Science), in which the author imagined riding alongside electricity
          that was traveling inside a telegraph wire. Einstein then asked
          himself the question that would dominate his thinking for the next 10
          years: What would a light beam look like if you could run alongside
          it? If light were a wave, then the light beam should appear
          stationary, like a frozen wave. Even as a child, though, he knew that
          stationary light waves had never been seen, so there was a paradox.
          Einstein also wrote his first “scientific paper” at that time (“The
          Investigation of the State of Aether in Magnetic Fields”).</p>
          <p>
          Einstein’s education was disrupted by his father’s repeated failures at 
          business. In 1894, after his company failed to get an important contract 
          to electrify the city of Munich, Hermann Einstein moved to Milan to work 
          with a relative. Einstein was left at a boardinghouse in Munich and expected 
          to finish his education. Alone, miserable, and repelled by the looming prospect 
          of military duty when he turned 16, Einstein ran away six months later and landed 
          on the doorstep of his surprised parents. His parents realized the enormous problems 
          that he faced as a school dropout and draft dodger with no employable skills. His 
          prospects did not look promising.</p>
          <p>
          Fortunately, Einstein could apply directly to the Eidgenössische Polytechnische 
          Schule (“Swiss Federal Polytechnic School”; in 1911, following expansion in 1909 
          to full university status, it was renamed the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, 
          or “Swiss Federal Institute of Technology”) in Zürich without the equivalent of a 
          high school diploma if he passed its stiff entrance examinations. His marks showed 
          that he excelled in mathematics and physics, but he failed at French, chemistry, 
          and biology. Because of his exceptional math scores, he was allowed into the polytechnic 
          on the condition that he first finish his formal schooling. He went to a special high 
          school run by Jost Winteler in Aarau, Switzerland, and graduated in 1896. He also 
          renounced his German citizenship at that time. (He was stateless until 1901, when 
          he was granted Swiss citizenship.) He became lifelong friends with the Winteler 
          family, with whom he had been boarding. (Winteler’s daughter, Marie, was Einstein’s 
          first love; Einstein’s sister, Maja, would eventually marry Winteler’s son Paul; 
          and his close friend Michele Besso would marry their eldest daughter, Anna.)</p>

          <p>
          Einstein would recall that his years in Zürich were some of the happiest 
          years of his life. He met many students who would become loyal friends, 
          such as Marcel Grossmann, a mathematician, and Besso, with whom he enjoyed 
          lengthy conversations about space and time. He also met his future wife, 
          Mileva Maric, a fellow physics student from Serbia.
        </p>
        

        <h2 class=" mt-4">From graduation to the “miracle year” of scientific theories of Albert Einstein</h2>
        <p>
          After graduation in 1900, Einstein faced one of the greatest crises in his
           life. Because he studied advanced subjects on his own, he often cut classes; 
           this earned him the animosity of some professors, especially Heinrich Weber. 
           Unfortunately, Einstein asked Weber for a letter of recommendation. Einstein 
           was subsequently turned down for every academic position that he applied to. 
           He later wrote,
          I would have found [a job] long ago if Weber had not played a dishonest game with me.
          </p>
          <p>
          Meanwhile, Einstein’s relationship with Maric deepened, but his parents vehemently 
          opposed the relationship. His mother especially objected to her Serbian background 
          (Maric’s family was Eastern Orthodox Christian). Einstein defied his parents, 
          however, and in January 1902 he and Maric even had a child, Lieserl, whose fate is 
          unknown. (It is commonly thought that she died of scarlet fever or was given up for adoption.)
          In 1902 Einstein reached perhaps the lowest point in his life. He could not marry 
          Maric and support a family without a job, and his father’s business went bankrupt. 
          Desperate and unemployed, Einstein took lowly jobs tutoring children, but he was 
          fired from even these jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The turning point came later that year, when the father of his lifelong friend Marcel 
          Grossmann was able to recommend him for a position as a clerk in the Swiss patent office 
          in Bern. About then, Einstein’s father became seriously ill and, just before he died, 
          gave his blessing for his son to marry Maric. For years, Einstein would experience 
          enormous sadness remembering that his father had died thinking him a failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a small but steady income for the first time, Einstein felt confident enough 
          to marry Maric, which he did on January 6, 1903. Their children, Hans Albert and 
          Eduard, were born in Bern in 1904 and 1910, respectively. In hindsight, Einstein’s 
          job at the patent office was a blessing. He would quickly finish analyzing patent 
          applications, leaving him time to daydream about the vision that had obsessed him 
          since he was 16: What would happen if you raced alongside a light beam? While at the 
          polytechnic school he had studied Maxwell’s equations, which describe the nature of light, 
          and discovered a fact unknown to James Clerk Maxwell himself—namely, that the speed of light 
          remains the same no matter how fast one moves. This violates Newton’s laws of motion, however, 
          because there is no absolute velocity in Isaac Newton’s theory. This insight led Einstein 
          to formulate the principle of relativity: “the speed of light is a constant in any inertial 
          frame (constantly moving frame).”
        </p>
      <h2 class=" mt-4">Research and Inventions</h2>

      <p>
        At first Einstein’s 1905 papers were ignored by the physics community.
        This began to change after he received the attention of just one physicist, 
        perhaps the most influential physicist of his generation, Max Planck, 
        the founder of the quantum theory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, owing to Planck’s laudatory comments and to experiments that 
        gradually confirmed his theories, Einstein was invited to lecture at 
        international meetings, such as the Solvay Conferences, and he rose 
        rapidly in the academic world. He was offered a series of positions 
        at increasingly prestigious institutions, including the University of 
        Zürich, the University of Prague, the Swiss Federal Institute of 
        Technology, and finally the University of Berlin, where he served 
        as director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics from 1913 
        to 1933 (although the opening of the institute was delayed until 1917).
      </p>
      <p>
        Even as his fame spread, Einstein’s marriage was falling apart. He was 
        constantly on the road, speaking at international conferences, and lost 
        in contemplation of relativity. The couple argued frequently about their 
        children and their meager finances. Convinced that his marriage was doomed, 
        Einstein began an affair with a cousin, Elsa Löwenthal, whom he later married. 
        (Elsa was a first cousin on his mother’s side and a second cousin on his 
        father’s side.) When he finally divorced Mileva in 1919, he agreed to give 
        her the money he might receive if he ever won a Nobel Prize.
        </p>
        <p>
        One of the deep thoughts that consumed Einstein from 1905 to 1915 was a 
        crucial flaw in his own theory: it made no mention of gravitation or 
        acceleration. His friend Paul Ehrenfest had noticed a curious fact. 
        If a disk is spinning, its rim travels faster than its centre, and 
        hence (by special relativity) metre sticks placed on its circumference 
        should shrink. This meant that Euclidean plane geometry must fail for the 
        disk. For the next 10 years, Einstein would be absorbed with formulating a 
        theory of gravity in terms of the curvature of space-time. To Einstein, 
        Newton’s gravitational force was actually a by-product of a deeper reality: 
        the bending of the fabric of space and time.
      </p>
      <p>
        His works were recognized across the world and in 1921,
        Einstein won the prestigious Nobel Prize for Physics for his significant work on the
        photoelectric effect. Let us dig into Albert Einstein’s inventions. Some
        inventions and contributions of Einstein are Avogadro’s Number, Quantum
        Theory of Light, General Theory of Relativity, Special Theory of
        Relativity, The Photoelectric Effect, Wave-Particle Duality, Brownian
        movement, the relationship between mass and energy, Bose-Einstein
        Condensate, and many more.

                In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed this theory, which is the base of
                modern Physics. It is the phenomenon that occurs when the material
                absorbs electromagnetic radiations and electrically charged
                particles are released from or within it. In this process, electrons
                are emitted from the metal plate when light falls on it. The emitted
                electrons are known as photoelectrons. In the photoelectric effect,
                the gamma-ray interacts with an electron of the inner shell of an
                atom of a radiation-absorbing material by transferring its energy
                totally to that electron. This results in the complete disappearance
                of the gamma photon and the ejection of an electron with energy
                equal to the energy of the initial gamma photon minus the binding
                energy of the electron. This binding energy is much smaller compared
                to the energy of the interacting gamma photon. The ejected electron
                can then induce events in a detector material. The electron gap in
                the inner shell is filled up by an electron of another shell and
                thus an X-ray photon is emitted.

              Einstein was the key person behind the quantum theory of light. He
              proposed and explained that light consists of packets of energy
              known as photons in 1905. He gave the physical interpretation to
              Planck’s mathematics when he proposed that electromagnetic radiation
              itself is granular, consisting of quanta with an energy hf. He also
              explained the emission of electrons from metals when hit with large
              electric pulses, like lightning. Quantum theory is a major
              intellectual achievement of the twentieth century, even though we
              are still discovering new knowledge in it. Several major
              experimental findings led to the revelation of quantum theory or
              quantum mechanics of nature. In nature, we know that many things are
              not infinitely divisible. Matter is not infinitely divisible as
              vindicated by the atomic theory of John Dalton (1766-1844) [221]. So
              fluid is not infinitely divisible: as when water is divided into
              smaller pieces, we will eventually arrive at water molecule, H2O,
              which is the fundamental building block of water. In turns out that
              electromagnetic energy is not infinitely divisible either. The
              electromagnetic radiation out of a heated cavity would obey a very
              different spectrum if electromagnetic energy is infinitely
              divisible. In order to fit experimental observation of radiation
              from a heated electromagnetic cavity, Max Planck (1900s) [222]
              proposed that electromagnetic energy comes in packets or is
              quantized. Each packet of energy or a quantum of energy E is
              associated with the frequency of electromagnetic wave, namely E = ~ω
              = ~2πf = hf

                Albert Einstein's theory of relativity is actually two separate
                theories: his special theory of relativity , postulated in the 1905
                paper, The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies and his theory of
                general relativity , an expansion of the earlier theory, published
                as The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity in 1916.
                Einstein sought to explain situations in which Newtonian physics
                might fail to deal successfully with phenomena, and in so doing
                proposed revolutionary changes in human concepts of time, space and
                gravity. The special theory of relativity was based on two main
                postulates: first, that the speed of light is constant for all
                observers; and second, that observers moving at constant speeds
                should be subject to the same physical laws. Following this logic,
                Einstein theorized that time must change according to the speed of a
                moving object relative to the frame of reference of an observer.
                Scientists have tested this theory through experimentation -
                proving, for example, that an atomic clock ticks more slowly when
                traveling at a high speed than it does when it is not moving. The
                essence of Einstein's paper was that both space and time are
                relative (rather than absolute), which was said to hold true in a
                special case, the absence of a gravitational field. Relativity was a
                stunning concept at the time; scientists all over the world debated
                the veracity of Einstein's famous equation, E=mc2
